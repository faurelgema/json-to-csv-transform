Presenting a series of inspiring profiles from various creative fields across industries and featuring more than 140 inspirational figures and 60 educational sessions with topics relevant to the development of the creative industry at the moment.\n\nLooking at the current changing situation that is heading in a better direction as well as very rapid technological advances, IdeaFest 2021 tries to respond to these changes by presenting a completely new creative festival experience in a hybrid way. IdeaFest 2021 inspirational sessions can also be watched live at M Bloc Space.\n\nTo fill the most awaited virtual conference stage, IdeaFest presented big names from home and abroad, including Tablo (Rapper, Producer, Songwriter, and Author), Kevin Kwan (Author of Crazy Rich Asians), Yvett Merino (Producer of Disney's “Encanto”), Byron Howard (Director of Disney's “Encanto”), Raffi Ahmad (Founder & Chairman of RANS Entertainment), Ridwan Kamil (Governor of West Java), Content and Creative, Disney+, The Walt Disney Company Southeast Asia), and some other big names.\n\nIdeaFest also presents a series of other inspirational figures such as Brian McGinn, Cecilia Soojeong Yi, Dian Sastrowardoyo, Jerome Kurnia, Wregas Bhanuteja, Afutami, Max Mandias, Sal Priadi, Sulaiman Said, Zico Halim, and many more.\n\nWith the spirit of Never Quit and the IdeaFest theme \"The Future of X\" which has the same meaning, it is hoped that it can build a strong generation in Indonesia and can become the latest reference for creative people and create cross-industry collaboration, Samara Live as the organizer consistently presents IdeaFest as a space for exchanging inspiration between Indonesian creative people.\n\nare you following the IdeaFest 2021 event?

Since pandemic, we've lost the touch of having this public gathering and conversing with many people. So I dedicated a moment by standing in this box from the first ever hybrid conference I attended yesterday 😌✌️✨ \n\nI chose to attend a talk of the most unfamiliar-familiar topic that tickles my curiosity; \"NFT & The New Economy\". To witness such discussion with little knowledge and zero experience, I've taken some keywords home and made those a homework😂. That was a really good way to start a journey to find out \"who's and what's\"  about the hit topic. They presented awesome speakers: illustrator to director of art media to NFT artist. This breakout topic has driven a lot of creators to make it in the digital world, but the lack of research and self-responsibility could create a set of troubles. A fast \"new-born-baby\" trend of technology has to be studied wisely. We cannot quickly judge or jump in without knowing what it can do and why we need to do it. The future is here and it's a fast paced. To join in, we must find out more within the community or simply consult with a friend. They suggest it wisely enough. \n\nIt was trully an awesome one hour session! If you guys happened to be around South Jakarta, go ahead and check out offline session of @ideafestid ✏️ at @mblocspace 📍and get those tickets! 🙌🏼😁. \n\n-\n#ideafest #ideafest2021 #mblocspace #nft #nftcommunity #nftindonesia #creativeeconomy #creator #digitalcreator"},"created_time":"1637958968","user":{"id":"1907913456","username":""},"link":"https://instagram.com/p/CWwLCbyhTXo","images":{"standard_resolution":{"url":"https://instagram.fcgk9-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-15/e35/p1080x1080/260855198_132464895833885_7725754241371584444_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fcgk9-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=105&_nc_ohc=j1-Z2M9O814AX-VsFSA&edm=ABZsPhsBAAAA&ccb=7-4&oh=00_AT-TJskfADuYolFdmg_Sba2MkzTWxNoKOkG9tEGuLsxgIg&oe=61E6A80F&_nc_sid=4efc9f"}},"likes":{"count":71},"comment":{"count":2},"object":{"social_media":"instagram","stream_type":"keyword","content":"IdeaFest2021"}},{"id":"2715610429262193102","caption":{"text":"#IdeaFest2021 is just around the corner.

Szerettünk volna egy problémára megoldást találni. \n—Fogyatékos gyerekeknek találtatok ki egy játékot. Miért?\n—H.A.: Nincs számukra megfelelő társasjáték.

Hogy segítette ez a munkátokat?\n—H.A.: Láthattuk, hogy milyen feladatokkal segítik a gondozók az autisták szociális integrációját. Ezt a tapasztalatot tudtuk beépíteni a társasjátékunkba. Ezúton is szeretnénk megköszönni a szakemberek segítségét.\n—M.A.: Jobban rálátunk, hogy mire képesek, mi az, amivel érdemes foglalkozni a fejlesztésükkel kapcsolatban.\n—Három fős csapatot kellett létrehozni, egy külsős diák lett a 3. csapattag. Milyen volt az együttműködés?\n—H.A.: Jól együtt tudtunk működni, Bajusz Péter (Andrássy Gyula Gimnázium) is sokat hozzá tett az ötlet kialakításához.\n—M.A.: Az Ideafest békés megyei startup mentora, Koszecz Sándor is segítette a munkánkat.
